# Identifying Hashes

- Navigate to https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes
- Look at the provided hash and identify it's structure - or the first characters present.
- Do a search (find) on your browser by pressing `Ctrl + F`.
- Use the first characters e.g `$6$` and the hash is identified -  for this example it's SHA512.
- The platform https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash also decrypts hashes but only those without separating colons.
